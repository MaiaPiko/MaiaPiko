## Pet Peeve Buster:

Pet Peeve Buster is a game based on the classic game “Breakout” but instead of destroying bricks you destroy your pet-peeves with the help on an adorable Eggling named Bluey. It was created with React and ReactPixi. The purpose of its creation was to draw a smile on the faces of a friend or two and to improve my React skills. Working on this game has helped me get up close and personal with some of React's features that I have never used before, and it also allowed me to truly think about and consider my app structure. Since the game contains many elements that needed to interact with one another, and so there was a lot of variable exchange.
